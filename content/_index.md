lead: "AI & Backend Software Engineer" 
---

Hi, I'm Amish! 👋

I am an  **AI & Backend Software Engineer** focused on building production-grade backend systems and AI-native systems - where strong backend foundations meet modern LLMs, agentic workflows, and retrieval-augmented generation.

My engineering foundation comes from **VMware (now Broadcom)**, where I worked on large-scale, high-availability distributed systems used by enterprise customers. Today, I apply that same rigor to Applied AI, helping startups move AI from prototypes into real production systems.

### What I Work On

I design and build **backend systems** that combine backend correctness with **native AI capabilities**, including:
+ Agentic AI workflows that reason, retrieve, and act
+ RAG pipelines for document intelligence and conversational Q&A
+ Multi-LLM platforms across OpenAI, Claude, Groq, and local models
+ Scalable backend services in Go and Python using event-driven architectures

+	<ins>AI Software Engineer</ins> @ **ArceusX** — agentic AI for VC due diligence

+	<ins>Member of Technical Staff</ins> @ **VMware / Broadcom** — distributed systems at scale


I’ve worked across **enterprise** and **startup** environments, collaborating closely with founders, product teams, and customers, and regularly demoing systems to stakeholders.
